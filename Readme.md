# Monte Carlo simulation

its a non diterministic methods to simulate a problem that start at a random value 
and result random value. everytime this simulation gives us a different result. using all  of 
the result it creates a a normalize distribuition which give a close result of actual behavior

# What is Daily Adjusted closing price?
Its the closing price where dividend and stock splis were taken into consideration to
get more accurate price value.
Dividend stocks are companies that pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders.
A stock split is when a company divides and increases the number of shares available 
to buy and sell on an exchange.

# what is daily log return?
For example, if a stock is priced at 3.570 USD per share at the close on one day, 
and at 3.575 USD per share at the close the next day, then the logarithmic return
is: ln(3.575/3.570) = 0.0014, or 0.14%.

# what is portfolio?
A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities,
cash, and cash equivalents, including closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
People generally believe that stocks, bonds, and cash comprise the core of a portfolio.

# what is portfolio expected return?
An expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average rate of return for all the assets
in the portfolio. The weights represent the proportion invested in each asset in the entire 
investment portfolio and can be found by simply multiplying each asset's rate of return with
its corresponding percentage.

A portfolio's return on investment (ROI) can be calculated as follows:
(Closing value - Starting balance )/ Starting Value.

# what is covariance matrix in stocks?
In the context of investment-related risk calculations, a variance-covariance
matrix is a rectangular matrix that contains the variances and covariances of 
the stocks in a portfolio. 

# what is value at risk?

Value at risk (VaR) is a measure of the potential loss that an asset, portfolio,
or firm might experience over a given period of time. Standard deviation, on the 
other hand, measures how much returns vary over time.

# what is conditional value at risk?

Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is the extended risk measure of value-at-risk that 
quantifies the average loss over a specified time period of unlikely scenarios beyond 
the confidence level.
